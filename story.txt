Story title: Whispers of an Airless Summer

"Is it real?", It's the unforeseen story of a boy who lives in London. He wakes up daily, goes to
college, comes home, does assignments, and helps parents at work. He has very few friends, which
obviously clarifies that he is an introvert. His parents used to work on a decent salary basis
and they provided him with a dreamful childhood. His parents have always granted him whatever he
has asked for; he has never heard any no's or but's. One day in an airless summer, something
happened that changed his life forever. He was walking on the streets of London when he met a
beggar. The beggar asked him to give him a few bucks. Rightfully so, the boy gave him 50 bucks
immediately. Then he walked away. To his utter surprise, the beggar also followed him all along.
Once their eyes met, the man turned his back around and sprinted in the opposite direction, out
of sight. The boy’s mind was too foggy to process what just happened, and he just went his way.
As he strolled through the streets of the English capital, the lad did feel again as if he were
being watched, or even worse, followed by someone or something. He tried to shrug it off by
playing the newly released album by his favorite band, Brockhampton, and trying to decipher the
lyrics. As he entered a disturbingly empty underground crossing tunnel, he felt shivers
throughout his body. He slowly looked behind him and noticed an entity—something that resembled a
human, but at the same time, its features were anything but humanlike. In a split second, he
dropped to the ground, unable to move or speak—a deadbeat. It felt surreal, making him question
his sanity and existence. Was this the end?

In a state of half-senses and half-paralyzed, he was sitting with fear and surprise. Suddenly, he
heard a bus or truck horn coming from outside the tunnel. The boy was terrified, unable to move
as the strange figure hovered over him in the dim tunnel. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the
figure vanished. Finally, he was able to move his body. He ran outside of the tunnel. He was
still feeling watched and paranoid. When he finally reached home and tried to explain to his
parents, there was a knock at the door. He freaked out in fear. When he opened the door, there
was nobody. When he reached home, his mom asked where he had been for so long on this hot day. He
replied, "Went to visit his friend," and went to his room. His mom made fruit juice, put some ice
on it, and placed it on the table. She noticed he was looking quiet and sitting in a chair with
his own thoughts. She asked him to drink the juice and take a nap. As soon as she left the room,
the boy drank the juice and went to sleep. After around 2 hours, he heard someone knocking on the
on the door, and he woke up. It was his mom asking him for snacks, but he denied it. He was still
numb from what happened to him in the tunnel. He read somewhere that sitting and focusing on the
breath make the mind calm. So he tried to focus on his breath while sitting on the floor. As soon
as he continued doing so, he realized that he was at ease. After some time, he opened his eyes
and decided to find out what really happened in that tunnel. He was thinking that the person or
beggar who was following him would ask for help. He was quite afraid to go back to the tunnel but
was also curious to know. He couldn't decide whether or not to tell his parents about the
incident. His inner voice was to sort this out on his own, but his mind, analyzing risks, was
asking him to take help. Will he explain this to his parents? 

As he grappled with the decision of whether to confide in his parents, another peculiar incident
occurred. Late at night, while he was scrolling through his phone, a message popped up from an
unknown number. The message contained only a cryptic string of numbers and letters, accompanied
by a chilling image that sent shivers down his spine. It was a photo of him, taken from behind,
walking through the tunnel earlier that day, but with an eerie figure lurking in the shadows
behind him. His heart raced as he tried to make sense of the message. Was it a prank, or was
someone else aware of what happened in the tunnel? The fear crept back in, intensifying his
dilemma about whether to seek help or face the mysterious events alone. Despite his growing
unease, curiosity gnawed at him like a relentless itch. He couldn't shake off the feeling that
there was more to the encounter in the tunnel than met the eye. In the dead of night, he found
himself drawn back to the scene of his inexplicable terror. Armed with nothing but a flashlight
and his fraying courage, he ventured into the dark depths once more. As he navigated the
labyrinthine tunnels, every sound seemed magnified, echoing off the damp walls and sending
shivers down his spine. Just when he thought he couldn't bear it any longer, he stumbled upon a
hidden alcove, concealed from view by layers of grime and neglect. In the dim glow of his
flashlight, he spotted something glinting amidst the shadows—a small, ornate box tucked away in a
corner. With trembling hands, he reached out and pried open the lid, revealing a collection of
old photographs and faded letters. As he rummaged through the box, his heart raced with
excitement. Suddenly he felt a vigorous shaking, and his eyes snapped open to see his mom
standing over him, her expression stern. "Babu uthhhhh!!! Dhila vai sakyooo" she scolded, her
voice echoing in his ears. Blinking away the remnants of sleep, he realized that the shaking was
just his mom angrily trying to get him out of bed because he was late for school. The images of
the box and its contents melted away as he focused on the reality of his room in Nepal. Yes,
Nepal! not London. Rubbing his eyes, he stumbled out of bed and hurriedly got ready for the day
ahead. As he rushed to the kitchen, he chuckled at the absurdity of his dream. Sitting down for 
Daal-Bhat, he couldn't help but laugh at how his mind had mixed up reality with fiction. Nepathya 
and Albatross instead of Brockthamption, and Patan gallis instead of a mysterious tunnel in 
London. It's all so silly. As he ate, he made a mental note to limit watching movies before bed. 
Who knows what other strange dreams might come his way if he doesn't? Maybe dreams weren't meant 
to make sense, he thought. But as long as they brought a smile to his face, he was more than 
happy to ride along with them.
