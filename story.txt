"Is it real?" 
It's the unforeseen story of a boy who lives in London. He 
wakes up daily, goes to college, comes home, does assignments, and helps 
parents at work. He has very few friends, which obviously clarifies that he 
is an introvert. His parents used to work on a decent salary basis, and they 
provided him with a dreamful childhood. His parents have always granted him 
whatever he has asked for; he has never heard any no's or but's. One day in 
an airless summer, something happened that changed his life forever. He was walking on the streets of London and he met a beggar.
The beggar asked him to give a few bucks. Rightfully so, the boy gave him 50 bucks immediately. Then he walked away.
To his utter surprise, the beggar also followed him all along. 
Once their eyes met, the man turned his back around and sprinted in the opposite direction, out of sight. The boy’s mind was too foggy to process what just happened and he just went his way.
As he strolled through the streets of the English capital, the lad did feel again as if he was being watched, or even worse – followed by someone, or something. 
He tried to shrug it off by playing the newly released album by his favorite band, Brockhampton and trying to decipher the lyrics. 
As he entered a disturbingly empty underground crossing tunnel, he felt shivers throughout his body. He slowly looked behind him and noticed an entity, something that resembled a human but at the same time its features were anything but humanlike.
In a split second, he dropped to the ground, unable to move or speak – deadbeat. It felt surreal, making him question his sanity and existence. Was this the end?

In the state of half in senses and half paralyzed, he was sitting with fear and surprise. Suddenly he heard a bus or truck horn may be coming from the road outside the tunnel. He picked himself up and walked towards his way to home. When he reached home, his mom asked where  he had been for so long in this hot day. He replied "Went to visit his friend" and went to his room. His mom made fruit juice, put some ice and placed in his table room. She noticed he was looking quite and sitting in chair in own thoughts. She asked him to drink the juice and take a nap. As soon as she left the room, the boy drank the juice and went to sleep. After around 2 hour he listened someone was knocking door and he wake up. It was his mom, asking her for snacks but he denied. He was still numb with what happened with him in tunnel. He read somewhere that sitting and focusing in breath makes mind calm. So he tried to focus on his breath sitting in floor. As soon as he continued doing so, he realized that he was coming at ease. After sometime, he opened his eyes and decided to find out what really happened in that tunnel. He was thinking that the person or beggar who ever was following him to ask for help. He was quite afraid to go back to the tunnel but was also curious to know. He was in dilemma whether to tell about this incident to his parents or not. His inner voice was to sort out this in his own but his mind analyzing risk was asking him to take help. Will he tell about this to his parents?............
