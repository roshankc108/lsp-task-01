Story title: Whispers of Airless Summer

"Is it real?" 
It's the unforeseen story of a boy who lives in London. He 
wakes up daily, goes to college, comes home, does assignments, and helps 
parents at work. He has very few friends, which obviously clarifies that he 
is an introvert. His parents used to work on a decent salary basis, and they 
provided him with a dreamful childhood. His parents have always granted him 
whatever he has asked for; he has never heard any no's or but's. One day in 
an airless summer, something happened that changed his life forever. He was walking on the streets of London and he met a beggar.
The beggar asked him to give a few bucks. Rightfully so, the boy gave him 50 bucks immediately. Then he walked away.
To his utter surprise, the beggar also followed him all along. 
Once their eyes met, the man turned his back around and sprinted in the opposite direction, out of sight. The boy’s mind was too foggy to process what just happened and he just went his way.
As he strolled through the streets of the English capital, the lad did feel again as if he was being watched, or even worse – followed by someone, or something. 
He tried to shrug it off by playing the newly released album by his favorite band, Brockhampton and trying to decipher the lyrics. 
As he entered a disturbingly empty underground crossing tunnel, he felt shivers throughout his body. He slowly looked behind him and noticed an entity, something that resembled a human but at the same time its features were anything but humanlike.
In a split second, he dropped to the ground, unable to move or speak – deadbeat. It felt surreal, making him question his sanity and existence. Was this the end?


In the state of half in senses and half paralyzed, he was sitting with fear and surprise.
Suddenly, he heard a bus or truck horn coming from outside the tunnel.
The boy was terrified, unable to move as the strange figure hovered over him in the dim tunnel. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the figure vanished. Finally he was able to move his body; He ran outside of the tunnel.
He was still feeling watched and paranoid. When he finally reached home and tried to explain to his parents, there was a knock at the door, he freaked out of fear.
When he opened the door, there was nobody. When he reached home, his mom
asked where  he had been for so long in this hot day. He replied "Went to visit his friend"
and went to his room. His mom made fruit juice, put some ice and placed in his table room. 
She noticed he was looking quite and sitting in chair in own thoughts. She asked him to drink
the juice and take a nap. As soon as she left the room, the boy drank the juice and went to sleep.
After around 2 hours, he listened someone was knocking door and he wake up. It was his mom, 
asking her for snacks but he denied. He was still numb with what happened with him in tunnel.
He read somewhere that sitting and focusing in breath makes mind calm. So he tried to focus
on his breath sitting in floor. As soon as he continued doing so, he realized that he was 
coming at ease. After sometime, he opened his eyes and decided to find out what really happened
in that tunnel. He was thinking that the person or beggar who ever was following him to ask for help.
He was quite afraid to go back to the tunnel but was also curious to know. He was in dilemma whether
to tell about this incident to his parents or not. His inner voice was to sort out this in his own 
but his mind analyzing risk was asking him to take help. Will he tell about this to his parents?

As he grappled with the decision of whether to confide in his parents, another peculiar incident occurred. Late at night, while he was scrolling through his phone, a message popped up from an unknown number. The message contained only a cryptic string of numbers and letters, accompanied by a chilling image that sent shivers down his spine. It was a photo of him, taken from behind, walking through the tunnel earlier that day, but with an eerie figure lurking in the shadows behind him. His heart raced as he tried to make sense of the message. Was it a prank, or was someone else aware of what happened in the tunnel? The fear crept back in, intensifying his dilemma about whether to seek help or face the mysterious events alone.

Despite his growing unease, curiosity gnawed at him like a relentless itch. He couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to the encounter in the tunnel than met the eye. In the dead of night, he found himself drawn back to the scene of his inexplicable terror. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and his fraying courage, he ventured into the dark depths once more.

As he navigated the labyrinthine tunnels, every sound seemed magnified, echoing off the damp walls and sending shivers down his spine. Just when he thought he couldn't bear it any longer, he stumbled upon a hidden alcove, concealed from view by layers of grime and neglect.

In the dim glow of his flashlight, he spotted something glinting amidst the shadows—a small, ornate box tucked away in a corner. With trembling hands, he reached out and pried open the lid, revealing a collection of old photographs and faded letters.
